# 5-HT1A_affinity_prediction_model
Affinity prediction model for 5-HT1A ligands, based on curated database (merged ZINC and ChEMBL databases)

In attached files, there are curated database (information of id, SMILES and pKi - affinity vaue) and the best prediction model of pKi affinity for the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor.

The curated database with mordred descriptors is avaiable with this link:
